Ohio Mine Subsidence Insurance Underwriters Association AUM GIS App - ArcObjects ArcGIS Desktop application that will gather all archived geologic data within a preset radius around a suspected subsidence location. The data will be loaded into an ArcMap so as to allow a geoscientist to review all the known archived data, and see if there may be evidence of underground mining nearby or if there is evidence of a minable coalbed nearby.
